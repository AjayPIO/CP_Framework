1). Most of the MRC tests are validating a different fio configuration against json reply of 
APA API.

2). MRC test cases are simply fio config files. Each config file is thus a MRC TC.

3). Please add new TCs with extension as '*.tc' . Please see existing TCs as example.

4). Specifying values for config vars : 
4.a) Comma separated values : Multiple iterations of TC execution with csv. 
EX: blocksizes = 4k, 8k, 16k, 32k

4.b) Range value : Iterate sequentially over each value as min and max.
EX: blocksize = 1k-4k
This will iterate over blocksizes of 1k, 2k, 3k, 4k

4.c). Single Value : Single value for config parameters.
EX: blocksize=16k

5). Directly supply the FIO command.
EX:
fio_cmd_str = "fio --name=randwrite --ioengine=libaio --iodepth=1 --rw=randwrite --bs=4k --direct=0 --size=512M --numjobs=8 --runtime=240 --group_reporting"

When fio is utilized as a basis of any reasonably large test suite, it might be desirable to share a set of standardized
settings across multiple job files. Instead of copy/pasting such settings, any section may pull in an external
filename.fio file with include filename directive, as in the following example:

; -- start job file including.fio --
[global]
filename=/tmp/test
filesize=1m
include glob-include.fio
[test]
rw=randread
bs=4k
time_based=1
runtime=10
include test-include.fio
; -- end job file including.fio --
